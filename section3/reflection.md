## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
- I felt like it was doable. I asked more questions on Slack and had to do a bit more Googling, but nothing felt overwhelming. If anything it was empowering to be able to do more on my own.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- I am guessing in most social media platforms, like Facebook, arrays are used to store one's photos in something like `var summer2021Photos = ["Climbing.jpeg", "Beach_Hang.jpeg"]`.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method refers to something that an array can do beyond storing a list of items. For example, with the use of certain methods, an array can append or delete items that are stored in it.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop allows us to repeat a block of code an *n* number of times. This saves us from copy-pasting the same line of code over and over, which is just sloppy, inefficient and makes for hard readability.
- A loop helps us iterate through the items in an array. We can access each item in the array without having to write a new line of code for each item index.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop goes around and around until you tell it to stop. For example, if I ask you to stack 5 lego blocks - you will probably go through the same motion of adding 1 block at a time until you did this action 5 times - then you stop. This is what a loop is - doing the same thing over and over until you reach a stopping point.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- It seems like you can put a loop inside a loop, but can you put an array in an array? I am also curious about what other commonly used conditions are used in the *condition* portion of a `for` loop.
