Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Honey Badger");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
// Add Elephants to the array
animals.unshift("Elephant");
// Log "Elephant"
console.log(animals[0]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Apple", "Carrot", "Fish", "Pear"];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length)

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("Broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("Corn", "Cake", "Bread");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift() // alternative: foods.splice(0,1);
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Myspace stores recent visitors in a list; ["CoolGuy666", "Billyl33t", "MissRad1990"]
// 2: Barnes & Noble has a list of books that you scroll through; ["Clifford", "The Little Prince", "Arthur"]
// 3: Ebay checkout has a list of items queud up that I am about to purchase; ["Empty Pizza Box", "Keytar", "Cool Shades"]

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
// A variable percentBatteryLeft is declared and assigned to the Number value of 12
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
// reassign percentBatteryLeft to the Number 89
// percentBatteryLeft = 89;

// A variable hasCharger is declared and assigned to the Boolean value of true
var hasCharger = true;
// reassign hasCharger to the Boolean value false
// hasCharger = false;

// A variable chargerType is declared and assigned to the String value of "Car"
var chargerType = "car";
// reassign chargerType to the String value "home"
// chargerType = "home";


// Write your conditional here
// First check if battery life is sufficient, if so - then run the code inside the braces
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15){
  // Log a message to console
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
} else if (hasCharger && chargerType === "car") { // Now check if user has a charger and that they have a "car" charger type, if so - then run the code inside the braces
  // Log a message to the console
  console.log("You can call an Uber, but you'll need to charge it in the car.");
} else { // If neither of the above conditons are met, then the user can't call an Uber, so run the code inside the braces
  // Log a message to the console
  console.log("Sorry bud, looks like you'll be walking home...")
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
