## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- I tend to wait too long before asking a question. I have a hard time being vulnerable, so I am hoping to overcome that while at turing. I want to have the confidence to ask questions without second guessing myself.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

##### Data types learned:
- **Number:** it's a datatype that deals with all sorts of numbers like negative numbers, integer numbers and floating point numbers. *e.g.* `89, -89, 89.99`
- **String:** is a datatype that is either a single character or set of characters. They can be declared with either single or double quotes encapsulating them. *e.g.* `"Hello", 'Howdy'`
- **Boolean:** is a binary datatype which is either 'true' or 'false'. Boolean types are usually returned when we use certain comparative statements. *e.g.* `8 !==5` evalutes as 'true', `8 > 900` evalutes as 'false'

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- `console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- `\\ comment here` is used to make a single line comment.
- `/* comments here */` is used to make a block or consecutive lines of comments.
- We use comments to keep the code organizes and legible. It's also a way to communicate what a line or block of code is doing to your teammembers or yourself (when you walk away from the code).

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A *variable* is like a box that holds one type of thing. Whenever you refer to that box, you're also bringing its contents as well.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- *GMAIL* is probably using the following variables:
- **username**; which stores a *string type*
- **validPassword**; which stores a *boolean type*
- **loginAttempts**; which stores a *number type*

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- *Concatenation* is a way of combining discrete strings and variables into one cohesive line.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- *Concatenation* is probably used by social media apps that have a welcome screen with your name. They likely have a
default message template and plug your name into it. e.g. `"Welcome to FaceSpace" + name`

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- I wanted to hear more about why/if concatenation is used more instead of interpolation? It seems like interpolation is
eaisier to work with and is way more readable.
